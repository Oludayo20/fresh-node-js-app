Task: Building a Bank Account System

create a simple bank account management system in JavaScript using concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

1. Create a BankAccount Class: Define a BankAccount class with the following properties:

accountNumber: A unique identifier for the bank account.
accountHolder: The name of the account holder.
balance: The current balance in the account.

2. Create Objects: Create instances of the BankAccount class to represent individual bank accounts for customers.

3. Implement Encapsulation: Encapsulate the properties of the BankAccount class. Use getter and setter methods to access and modify these properties.

4. Inheritance: Create specialized account classes that inherit from the BankAccount class. For example, create classes like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount. Each of these classes should inherit properties and methods from the BankAccount class but may also have their own unique properties and methods.

5. Add Methods: Implement methods for the specialized account classes. For example, you can add methods like deposit(amount) to deposit money, withdraw(amount) to withdraw money, and calculateInterest() for savings accounts.

6. Create a Bank Class: Create a Bank class that manages a collection of bank accounts. The Bank class should have methods like:
   addAccount(account): Add a bank account to the bank.
   removeAccount(accountNumber): Remove a bank account based on the account number.
   listAccounts(): List all bank accounts in the bank.

7. Test Your System: Create instances of the Bank class and add various bank accounts to the bank. Test your bank account system by adding accounts, removing accounts, and listing the accounts in the bank.

8. Additional Features (Optional): You can extend the system by adding features like transferring funds between accounts, calculating interest, and displaying transaction history.

Submission: use the usual way of submission. next meeting connect with your laptop also so u can explain the code you've written.
